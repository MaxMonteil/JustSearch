# JustSearch

An interview challenge that required the use of VueJS, Typescript, and Vuex to offer a webapp using the [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com) search API.

A super fun project and finally a chance to get into Typescript.

I have deployed the site to netlify [here](https://justsearch.netlify.app/) but it doesn't seem like their API is accepting requests from that origin.

## Project setup

**Very Important**
Don't forget to copy the `env.example` file to a `.env.local` one, the app expects to be able to find a couple of environment variables there.

```
npm install
cp env.example .env.local
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
