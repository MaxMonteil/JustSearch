# JustSearch

An interview challenge that required the use of VueJS, Typescript, and Vuex to offer a webapp using the [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com) search API.

A super fun project and finally a chance to get into Typescript.

## Project setup

**Very Important** Don't forget to copy the `env.example` file to a `.env.local` one, the app expects to be able to find a couple of environment variables there.
```
npm install
cp env.example .env.local
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

### Compiles and minifies for production
